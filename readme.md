# matlabcontrol

The real homepage of this project is [here](https://code.google.com/p/matlabcontrol/).  The purpose of this fork is to allow DiffPlug to make a few improvements, which may or may not be of use to the community at large (hopefully they will be!).  Huge thanks to Joshua Kaplan and the other authors of matlabcontrol, it's a great project.

This was forked from 4.1.0.

## Changes from 4.1.0

- Switched to gradle, which makes the jmistub subproject unnecessary.

## Quickstart

All the good stuff is in `matlabcontrol`.  Go there and `gradlew build` to build and test, or `gradlew eclipse` to create Eclipse project files, or `gradlew publish` to publish to maven.
